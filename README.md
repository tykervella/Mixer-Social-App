## DESCRIPTION 

Week 18 Challenge for Full-Stack Programming bootcamp at the University of Washington in partnership with edX. This is a back-end application that utilizes node and mongoDB in conjunction with mongoose to create a mock social media application. This provides the models, routes and controllers to allow users and thoughts to be viewed, created, edited and deleted. As well, users can add friends to their friend list and reactions to other users thoughts.
